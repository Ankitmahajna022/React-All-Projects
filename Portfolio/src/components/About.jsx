            <p>
                I’m Ankit Mahajan, a passionate Web Developer from Surat, Gujarat, with strong hands-on experience in building modern, responsive, and scalable web applications. I specialize in front-end development using React.js and have solid backend experience with Node.js, Express.js, and databases like MongoDB and Firebase.

                I enjoy transforming ideas into clean, user-friendly interfaces and reliable backend systems. Through projects such as chat applications, management systems, and RESTful APIs, I have developed a strong understanding of full-stack development, state management, API integration, and database design.

                I am always eager to learn new technologies, improve performance, and write clean, maintainable code. My goal is to grow as a professional developer and contribute to impactful real-world projects while continuously upgrading my technical skills.
